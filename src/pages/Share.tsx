// What is a shareable link?
// A link that can be shared with other people to access your brain
// Does this link has any expiration limit?
// If it does not have any expiration limit than what is the need for a shareable link then ?
// It should have a expiration limit and after that limit has expired the link should no longer remain valid
// The user will have to generate a new link by clicking on the share brain button
// So on the frontend we will have a endpoint on which the frontend will send a unique id generated by the backend and saved in the browser cookies and on if everything remains ok then only we will send all the posts to the user

// When I click on the share brain button a request will be sent to the backend and a jwt token will be generated with a shorter expiration time and that jwt will be returned to the user back again and now /public/(jsonwebtoken) at this url whenever anybody go a request will be made to the backend to fetch all the posts of that user and if the token has expired than the server will return that the link has expired. The token will contain the username only through that we will query the database. The token will get expired in 1hour only
